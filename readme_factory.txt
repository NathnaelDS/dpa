The factory method defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
In factory pattern, we replace the use of the "new" keyword way of making classes by making classes that take care of the object's creation.
It has the advantage of deciding to some extent what the objects will look like without knowing the implementation.
